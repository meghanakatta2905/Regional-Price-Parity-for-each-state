📁 Dataset Overview

Source: Public rent price datasets
Focus: U.S. regional rent prices by state and metro
Features Used:
	•	Region Name (State/Metro)
	•	Rent Price
	•	Time Series Data

⸻

📊 Key Tasks & Approach

🔍 Data Preprocessing & Exploration
	•	Cleaned and reshaped time series data using dplyr and tidyr
	•	Aggregated rent prices at state and metro levels
	•	Handled missing values and removed inconsistent entries

📈 Visualizations Built
	•	Trend Lines showing rent changes over time by region
	•	Heatmaps of rent levels by state
	•	Correlation Matrices to understand how regional rents move together
	•	Redesigned Bar and Line Charts for better clarity and focus

⸻

✅ Results & Insights
	•	Clear differences in rent growth between coastal and inland states
	•	Strong correlations between urban areas with similar economic profiles
	•	Redesigned plots enhanced insight delivery by reducing clutter and improving labeling
	•	Heatmaps highlighted high-cost clusters across major cities
